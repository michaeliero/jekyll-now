I'm currently a law student and on track to become a lawyer. I'm in my mid-twenties. This site doesn't use my real name, as I truly believe in the value of pseudonyms and the ability to speak your mind without people in your daily life realizing how crazy you really are. That's something I only share with family, close friends, and apparently the public internet. I assume, though, if you cared enough you could find it somehow, and at that point you deserve to know too.
