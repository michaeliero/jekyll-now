title: Pre-Calculus Review: Geometry
---
Finally beginning this. Here is my pre-calculus review, in preparation for my calculus review. Will try to put this up at some type of regular interval. I want to reiterate that I'm in no way an expert on this material—in fact, I'm probably not qualified to discuss this—but this is just my understanding of it. If you have any comments, questions, angry reactions, etc., please let me know. Here goes:

## Intro 
The hardest thing for me when it comes to math is to memorize the various rules and definitions. It's part of the language used to describe the various relationships and problems you encounter. There's no way around it, and that's especially true for this introductory material. I use Anki (Google it) to memorize concepts when necessary, but use whatever works best for you. If you use the material enough, though, you won't have to actively memorize the concepts. So, if you're so inclined, just keep playing with these concepts in your mind throughout the day, and soon they'll ljust be a part of your long-term memory.

## Geometry
### Sum of Angles
One degree is equal to 1/90th of a right angle. That's just the definition. Accept it. There might be a reason for this, but I don't know it. This also means that two right angles together make up 180 degrees. From this, the intuition arises that when angles form a straight line, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees (because that's what two right angles form when put together). There's probably a more mathematical way to describe this, but again I'm just an amateur, and that's how I explain it.

When a line cuts across parallel lines, then the corresponding angles are equal to each other. The alternate itnerior angles are equal as well:

This line that cuts through the parallel lines is called a "transversal."

From this, we can conclude that the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Here's the proof:

![title](file:///Users/AMP/Desktop/GitHub%20Repository/michaeliero.github.io/images/Proof%20for%20180%20Degrees%20for%20Triangles.png)

This means that the sum of the acute angles in a right triangle is 90 degrees (because the right angle is itself 90 degrees, and that leaves 90 degrees left for the two other angles to fill in).

Finally, in any triangle, an exterior angle equals the sum of the opposite interior angles:

Here's my informal proof for this:
$$ \begin{align} 
	C + D &= 180 degrees \\
	A + B + C &= 180 degrees \\
	
	Substitute 180 degrees with C + D:
	A + B + C &= C + D \\
	A + B &= D
$$
