title: Hard Time Starting
--

I've had a hard time trying to fit into my schedule writing these blog posts, and life recently hasn't made that easy on myself. A myriad of intense classwork, bed bugs, getting sick, and pure inertia has kept me from writing regularly. Working on habits is hard. But I'll keep at it and try to fit this in.

A major obstacle I'm dealing with is trying to find something to write about every dayâ€”something that I learned that I want to share. Maybe I need to branch out more and include what I'm learning in class too. That might make it easier to get into the habit.

The other obstacle I'm dealing with is getting comfortable with the tools at my disposal. This Jekyll framework is intuitive, but I still need to put in the minimal level of work to get familiar with it.

Basically, I need to make a commitment, and stick with it. At least I have that clarity.
