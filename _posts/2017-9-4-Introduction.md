title: Why I'm Starting This Blog
---

I started this blog with a simple vision: to explain the world that I was witnessing and learning. There are a ton of websites that give you "how-tos" or "follow this list" instructions. There aren't many showing the journey into discovering these steps. (Though, admittedly, that is the point of personal blogs, of which there are millionsâ€”for all I know, there's an exact duplicate of this blog out there somewhere.) I wanted to create a space where I would share with everyone what I'm learning, how I learned it, why I learned it, how I'm going to use it, etc. This is my first step toward that goal. ```I envision 4 main subjects: programming, math, economics, and copyright. There might be other topics sprinkled in, but that's my plan for now.``` UPDATE (2017-10-11): I thought I'd have some plan, but for now I'm going to write my thoughts and musings about various topics until I'm competent enough on any one topic to start having a programmatic approach to it. And that might be the first thing I've learned: to start building a habit, you have to make the barrier of entry as low as possible.

I don't claim to be an expert. On the contrary, I want to give the perspective of a newcomer, someone who'll be lost and get things wrong, someone who's stumbling over the material and trying to find the best way to explain what he's learning. If you read something and think "that doesn't sound right," it might be perfectly legitimate, and I want to know about it. Any and all criticism are highly encouraged and welcome. Even if you want to just throw some angry epithets my way, please do. God knows my ego could use a check. 

With that, the races are off.
